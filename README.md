This repository has been inspired from the Stanford course (CS 231N) on Convolutional Neural Networks. It consists of various assignments to teach you in detail about the use and different applications of CNNs.

Application 1 consists of basic function writing of different CNN functions like KNNs, dropout functions, pooling layers, gradient ddescent functions. 

The course further gets complicated by assignment 3, which covers topics like Generative Adverserial Networks
